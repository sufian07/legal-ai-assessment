**Title:** AI Engineer Take-Home Assessment — Document Understanding, Grounded Drafting, and Improvement from Edits
**Deadline:** Friday, May 15, 2026 (end of day, your local time).

## Context

You are joining Pearson Specter Litt as an AI Engineer. The team needs an internal workflow that ingests messy legal-style documents, pulls usable information out of them, and turns that information into grounded draft outputs an operator can edit.

The inputs will not be clean. Expect scanned pages, low-resolution PDFs, handwritten notes, partially illegible records, and inconsistently formatted files. Your system has to cope with that.

At a high level, the system you build should:

- ingest and process the source documents,
- extract usable text and structured fields,
- retrieve relevant evidence from those documents,
- generate grounded draft responses or legal-style drafts, and
- get better over time by learning from how operators edit the default drafts.

The kind of draft output you choose to generate is up to you. Reasonable picks include:

- a title review summary,
- a case fact summary,
- a notice-related summary,
- a document checklist, or
- a first-pass internal memo.

Whatever you choose, the output must be grounded in the underlying documents. We are not looking for confident-sounding text built on unsupported assumptions.

## Task Requirements

### 1. Document Processing

Accept messy legal-style documents and pull useful content out of them. Concretely:

- OCR or text extraction over scanned or noisy files
- reasonable handling of partially unclear inputs
- produce extracted text plus structured data that downstream steps can actually use

The output of this stage should be ready to feed into retrieval and drafting without further cleanup.

### 2. Grounded Retrieval

Build a retrieval layer over the processed documents so that generation is anchored to actual source material. The retrieval layer should:

- surface the relevant passages for a given drafting task,
- feed that evidence into the generation step, and
- make it possible to inspect which evidence supported which part of the output.

The goal is grounded answering, not generic generation.

### 3. Draft Generation

Using the processed content and retrieved evidence, generate a draft response or draft legal-style output. A good draft is:

- relevant to the provided documents,
- grounded in retrieved evidence, and
- structured well enough to be useful as a first pass.

We are not evaluating legal correctness. We are evaluating whether the output is well supported by the source material and whether the system around it is designed well.

### 4. Improvement from Operator Edits

Assume an operator reviews the default draft and edits it. Your system should:

- capture those edits,
- extract something reusable from them, and
- use that signal to make future drafts better.

We are looking for a real improvement loop, not a side-by-side version diff.

## Notes

- You may use mock or synthetic sample documents.
- You may simulate operator edits if needed.
- Keep the scope practical.
- We care more about engineering quality, grounding, and thoughtful design than visual polish.
- Your README, architecture notes, and sample inputs/outputs matter as much as the code — don't skip them.
- Scope down where needed — pick the parts you can do well and ship those cleanly.

## How to Submit

1. Push your work to a GitHub repository.
2. Invite [github.com/tsensei](https://github.com/tsensei) and [github.com/abubakarsiddik31](https://github.com/abubakarsiddik31) as collaborators.
3. Email `talha@ideabuilders.studio` with your repo link and a short intro about yourself — so we know you've submitted and have a bit of context on you before reviewing.

**Deadline:** Friday, May 15, 2026.

## Reviewer Focus

A strong submission should clearly show:

- how messy documents are processed,
- how retrieval supports the generated output,
- how the draft stays grounded in source evidence, and
- how operator edits improve future results.
